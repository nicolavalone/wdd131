                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Nícola Valone. I was born in João Pessoa, the capital of Paraíba state, in the northeast part of Brazil.
                    I'm married with 3 sons. Currently, I have my own business, in which I help people to improve their communication
                    in English and Spanish, based on a proprietary method I have developed. In my free time, I love spending time with
                    my family. I also play the guitar and like to spend some time recording my favorite songs to my YouTube channel. 
                </p>
